# Exercises on hakerrank:
In this homework you can find the solutions about the exercises that I did on "https://www.hackerrank.com/".

I upload the file "Homework1_ADM.py" where is the code about the exercises that I did. Here I arranged the exercises as I saw on the "homework1.pdf".

There is another file "screenshot.pdf" where are the screnshoot of the submissions. 

I also create a "commets" file, where I wrote additional comments about my homework as to be well organised.
I also did AWS' exercises.
